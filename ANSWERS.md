## Questions

1. What is the difference between new and create for a model?
'new' creates an instance, 'create' will create an instance and save it to the database.

2. What command combined with new will emulate the same behavior as create?
'save'

3. What is the default integer column that exists on every table but we did NOT define?
'id'

4. What single line of ruby code can insert a cat with the name "Kira" in the database?
Cat.create(name:'Kira')

5. How did you like this homework in comparison with the previous homeworks?
Liked that it combined everything but not so much work! Showed us easy commands. In lecture though I really wish TAs would talk more enthusiastically and loudly/clearly. It is hard to focus for 1.5 hours if monotone/quiet especially at the end of the day.
